info of game :

This game is an obstacle course and at the same time a race against the opponent.

In the first stage you will have to collide with stars (carriers of light) that are coming towards you and when they collide, they will take particles of light from you, which you will chase to collect your star and go to the next level.

the second stage is a snake game, but not a classic one
you will need to score 35 points, but do not think that it is so easy, because you are not playing alone, but with an opponent, and when he eats a point, an obstacle will appear in that place on your field, which, when hit, will take away all your points, but the obstacles will remain
